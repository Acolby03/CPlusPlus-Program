# CPlusPlus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was about building a C++ program that calculates how an investment grows over time. The program takes in an initial investment, a monthly deposit, an annual interest rate, and the number of years, then shows the growth both with and without monthly deposits. It solves the problem of helping users easily see how compound interest works and how much they could earn under different conditions.

# What did you do particularly well?

One thing I think I did particularly well was making the code easy to follow and organized. I used functions to separate the calculations for balances with and without deposits, and I added inline comments so someone reading the program can understand the logic without much trouble. I also kept the input and output user-friendly, which is important for a financial tool.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

If I were to enhance my code, I would improve the error handling for user input and add formatting to display the dollar amounts more cleanly. I could also add unit tests to make sure the calculations stay accurate as the program grows. These improvements would make the program more secure and reliable.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The hardest part for me was getting the compound interest math right with monthly deposits. At first my totals were off, but I went back, broke the formula down step by step, and used testing with sample numbers to check my results. I relied on both the course resources and some online examples of compound interest formulas to overcome this.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skills I learned from this project transfer well to other coding work. Breaking down a problem, writing functions to keep code reusable, and making sure logic matches real-world formulas are all things I’ll use again in future projects.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable and adaptable by keeping the functions separate, adding comments, and writing clear variable names. If I or someone else wanted to extend the program later—for example, adding graphs or more financial options, it would be much easier to build on top of what’s already there.
